# Summary
- Positive isolation prevents accidental release of hazardous materials or energy to work areas, ensuring safety and preventing accidents
- Working on live equipment without positive isolation is dangerous and unsafe
- Purposes of positive isolation include maintenance, installing new equipment, shutdown work, and cleaning
- Types of positive isolation: spool removal (air gaping), blind isolation, single valve isolation, and double block & bleed (DBB) isolation
- Spool removal involves removing a pipe section and fixing a blind to stop hazardous material flow
- Blind isolation inserts a blind (spade) between flanges, useful when spool removal is difficult
- Single valve isolation uses one valve and is suitable for routine, short duration, low pressure, cold work
- Double block & bleed (DBB) isolation is considered the most secure form of valve isolation, using two valves in series with a bleed valve between them

# Purpose of positive isolation
1. For Maintenance

4. For Cleaning

# Types of Positive isolation
### 1.Spool removal also called air gaping isolation
Spool removal is a method of isolation in which isolation is done by removing a spool section (pipe) from the pipeline, and fixing a blind at the end of process pipeline to stop the flow of hazrardous material to the work area.

### 2.Blind isolation
Blind isolation refers to the insertion of a blind (spade) between two flanges. In installations where spool removal is difficult to implement, isolation by a valve and line-rated spade provides the next highest level of security. The blind may be inserted by replacing a spacer ring with a line blind or rotating the blind end of a spectacle blind into place that has been installed on the flange. A spectacle blind is a permanent installation designed to simplify the change-over between a blind and an open-spacer.

Blind isolation still requires physical labor and manual intervention consuming manpower, resources and time, especially with large bore piping systems. Maintenance workers may still encounter problems like rusted bolts or a damaged gasket that must be replaced. The blind portion of a spectacle blind often gets corroded and may need to be scraped and cleaned before it can be used. Spool removal and blind isolation are generally recommended for situations where isolation is expected to last longer than a month.

### 3.Single Valve Isolation
As the name suggests, single valve isolation uses only one valve to isolate the source from the work area. The isolation is critically dependent upon the reliability of the seal and the integrity of the single valve operating stem. Such a system may only be used for the purpose of swinging a spectacle blind, inserting a line spade or fitting a blind flange to achieve higher integrity isolation.

Single valve isolations may only be considered for routine, short duration, low pressure, cold work.

### 4.Double Block & Bleed Isolation
A Double block and bleed (DBB) isolation system is considered to be the most secure form
of valve isolation. It consists of two valves in series, with a bleed valve in between, that allows the pressure/material, between the two valves, to be bled through a vent directed to a safe location. To achieve isolation, the two main valves are closed and the bleed valve is opened. The DBB configuration shuts down a section of the pipe on both sides rather than just one. Double block and bleed isolation reduces the risk of harm to people and the environment. It is considered to be the minimum sole means of isolation for cold routine short duration work at moderate to high pressures.



Complex work processes, combined with tight maintenance windows, present a challenge
for installation and maintenance personnel in the oil & gas sector and other industries. Many companies have adopted the policy of mandatory DBB isolation when maintenance work is being performed on field equipment. A DBB installation can reduce the maintenance and installation effort considerably while providing a process safety solution for positive isolation on both sides.
